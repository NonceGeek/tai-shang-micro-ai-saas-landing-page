Yesterday on YouTube, I watched a presentation on the transformative potential of decentralized knowledge graphs for DeSci, featuring Jurij Skornik and Charlie Edwards, discussing the evolution of knowledge management towards systems that improve verifiability, data ownership, and incentivization in scientific research.


["What's new in AI Dim Sum Lab?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yihwo9FdnJg&list=PLYCWARA8YNdqQs3wnZEYk-aPAxpbNv8e4) is a series of 12 short videos that teach you everything you need to know about some of our favorite new AI Dim Sum Lab APPfeatures.

{/*/excerpt*/}

In this presentation at the DeSci Berlin Conference, Jurij Skornik (General Manager at Trace Labs, core developers of OriginTrail), and Charlie Edwards (Investment Analyst at ID Theory), delve into the transformative potential of decentralized knowledge graphs for advancing decentralized science (DeSci). 

They explore the evolution of knowledge management from traditional models to innovative decentralized systems that enhance verifiability, data ownership, and incentivization in scientific research. 

The speakers discuss the integration of blockchain technology with AI to create a verifiable internet for AI, emphasizing the importance of trust, data provenance, and efficient information sharing across global scientific communities. 

Their discussion highlights the use of DKGs to foster collaboration, improve data accessibility, and drive innovation in scientific research through enhanced AI capabilities.
