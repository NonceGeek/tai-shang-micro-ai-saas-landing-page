## Token-Based Incentive Model

One of the key features of `decsi.cyou` is its token-based incentive system. Researchers earn tokens for their contributions, which can be exchanged for services, funding, or even converted into cryptocurrency. This system ensures that the value of scientific contributions is directly recognized and rewarded.
