## VitaDAO and Pfizer: A Milestone in DeSci

In January 2023, VitaDAO, a DeSci startup focused on longevity, announced a $4.1 million funding round. The notable contributors included Pfizer Ventures, marking Pfizer’s first Web3 investment. The funds will be used to advance longevity research and support biotech startups emerging from VitaDAO. Following this news, VitaDAO’s governance token, VITA, saw a 60% increase in value.

## A New Approach to Biotech Funding

Biotech funding traditionally relies on equity financing, loans, or government grants. However, these avenues often face limitations due to the long and costly R&D processes. With tightening monetary policies and economic uncertainty, traditional funding channels have become less viable. VitaDAO offers a decentralized alternative, where funding is driven by DAO votes and decentralized finance tools, potentially bypassing the constraints of traditional capital.

VitaDAO’s innovative approach also democratizes funding, enabling projects that might have been overlooked by conventional investors to receive the support they need. This model could revolutionize how biotech startups are funded, allowing even niche or long-term projects to thrive.

## Transforming Information Access in Science

DeSci’s impact isn’t limited to funding; it also addresses information access issues. Traditional platforms like Elsevier create barriers with expensive paywalls, while political and corporate influences can skew the availability of scientific data. VitaDAO, through its decentralized structure, facilitates a more open exchange of knowledge. Researchers contributing to the DAO receive VITA tokens and governance rights, encouraging active participation and knowledge sharing.

By leveraging blockchain's decentralized storage and censorship resistance, VitaDAO ensures that scientific data remains accessible and secure. This shift could lead to more inclusive and collaborative research environments, breaking down the information silos that have long plagued scientific progress.

## The Future of DeSci with VitaDAO

VitaDAO’s collaborations, such as those with Mantis Photonics and major universities, illustrate DeSci's evolving role in clinical research and its expanding application. As DeSci organizations like VitaDAO grow, we may see unprecedented cross-border and cross-discipline collaborations that could tackle global challenges—potentially overcoming the barriers that have historically limited shared scientific advancements.
